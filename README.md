### What is c4recover

c4recover is a command line program used to remove Locked Modified Assets (LMA) from a 
Cilization 4, Beyond the Sword save.  This is useful if you have a LMA-enabled save that you
cannot load because Beyond the Sword files on your computer do not match the locked assets.

Note that removing LMA from a save may enable the save to load; however, since the assets on
your computer do not match that of the save, the game might not behave properly.  For this reason,
it is best to change assets on your computer to match the save if at all possible.  Only as a 
last resort should c4recover be used.
